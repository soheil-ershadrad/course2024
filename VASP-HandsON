VASP Hands Ons:

You need to have a ssh connection to our computer to be able to run calculations there:
If you have MAC or Linux, open a terminal and use the following command, and password given to you in the class:

"ssh -X course2024@biplab-Precision-7960-Tower.physics.uu.se"

If you have Windows, you need to install a ssh client software like putty:

"https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html"

After installation use the following information to get connected:
port : 22
user : course2024
host : biplab-Precision-7960-Tower.physics.uu.se

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will work in linux environment, so we need to know a few useful commands in linux:

"ls"   # to see the content of a folder
"pwd"  # to see the address to the current directory 
"mkdir folder_name"   # to create a folder inside the current directory
"cd <folder_name>"   # to go to a folder inside the current directory
"cd <directory_address>"   # to go to a special directory
"cd ../"   # to go one folder back
"cd ../../"   # to go two folders back
"cp ../my_file ."   # to copy a file, name my_file to the current folder from one folder out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We always need at least 4 initial input files to start a VASP job.

POSCAR : contains structural information
INCAR : contains the tags that tells details of our jobs to the software
KPOINRS : contains information about grids in reciprocal lattice
POTCAR : contains predefined potentials

Other inputs may be required for specific calculations. 

POSCAR format:
line1 : comment
line2 : scale for lattice parameters
line3-5 : lattice vectors 
line6 : elements
line7 : number of elements
line8 : cartesian or direct, tell about how we define atomic coordination with respect to lattice vector
line9-n : atomic coordinations

POSCAR example:
AFM  NiO
 4.17
 1.0 0.5 0.5
 0.5 1.0 0.5
 0.5 0.5 1.0
 Ni  O
 2   2
Cartesian
 0.0 0.0 0.0
 1.0 1.0 1.0
 0.5 0.5 0.5
 1.5 1.5 1.5

KPOINTS example:
k-points
 0
gamma
 4  4  4 
 0  0  0

* we usually only modify  4th line that specifies number of cuts along each direction in reciprocal space

POTCAR files are provided by VASP developers and are licensed, so we need to download them.

To understand INCAR tags the best reference is VASP wiki.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A- self consistence field calculations (SCF)
Here we only solve the schrodinger equation (Kohn-Sham equation) for electrons. 
We will have some iterations (electronic steps) to find the electronic configuration that minimizes the total energy.

Steps to follow:
1- create a folder by "mkdir <folder_name>    # you choose the folder name
2- copy POSCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR, INCAR files in this folder by 
"cp /home/course2024/lab/examples/GaAs/sc/POSCAR . "
"cp /home/course2024/lab/examples/GaAs/sc/KPOINTS . "
"cp /home/course2024/lab/examples/GaAs/sc/INCAR . "
"cp /home/course2024/lab/examples/GaAs/sc/POTCAR . "

3- You can modify files if needed by "nano <file_name>" like "nano POSCAR", an alternative is "vi POSCAR" but working with nano is easier for beginners.

4- Submit calculation job to the computer by "vasp_std" 
* Alternatively, if you want to store the outputs in a separate file instead of seeing them on the screen, use "vasp_std > vasp.out".  

5- When you see "reached required accuracy - stopping structural energy minimisation" on you screen, the calculation is done.

6- Check the outputs, especially "OUTCAR" file that contains the most important information about calculation results.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B- Convergence with respect to KPOINTS, and cutoff energy:
1- Create a new folder by "mkdir kpoints_conv"
2- Use the input files from the previous calculation.
3- Vary the kpoints grid uniformly from 5 to 35 in steps of 5, i.e. 5 5 5, 10 10 10, 15 15 15, ..., 35 35 35. Do each calculation in a separate folder, "mkdir 5"  for example for the first calculation.
4- Plot the kpoints_number vs. total energy. At which Kpoints the total energy is converged?

6- Create a new folder by "mkdir encut_conv"
7- Use the input files from the scf calculation and the converged KPOINTS from the previous step.
8- Vary the ENCUT input in the INCAR file, from 50 to 750 in steps of 100 eV, i.e. ENCUT = 50. Do each calculation in a separate folder, "mkdir 50"  for example for the first calculation.
9- Plot the ENCUT_value vs. total energy. At which ENCUT value the total energy is converged?

* The Kpoints and ENCUT convergence should be done for each material separately, but as a rule of thumb, ENCUT = 500 eV is good for most of systems. 
KPOINTS convergence should be done in most cases depending on our calculations' sensitivity. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C- 3D vs 2D vs 1D vs 0D
1- Find the eigen values of H atom, for this you need to do a scf calculation on a Hydrogen atom in a box (0D system).
Q1- Should we do KPOINTS convergence?

2- Do scf calculation for graphene monolayer (2D system).
Q2- How do we create a graphene monolayer out of bulk graphite?
Q2- Should we do KPOINTS convergence?

3- 1D systems
Q1- What is an example of 1D system?
Q2- How does the reciprocal space look like for a 1D system?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D- Structural optimizations
D1- Internal optimization (atomic relaxation)
1- Relax the atomic structure of the CO molecule "cp /home/course2024/lab/examples/CO/POSCAR .", for this, you need to modify the INCAR file only.
2- ADD these tags to the INCAR file: 
IBRION = 2
NSW = 100
EDIFFG = -0.01
3- What is the meaning with these tags?
4- What is the equilibrium C-O bond length?


D2- Cell optimization
1- Optimize the lattice parameter of Gold (materials project ID: mp-81). 
2- For this you need to vary the lattice parameter in the POSCAR file, between 4.0 and 4.3 in steps of 0.1, and find the minimum of energy vs. lattice parameter.


D3- Cell optimization + atomic relaxation
1- Optimize the Au cell automatically, by modifying the INCAR file:
ISIF = 3
IBRION = 2
NSW = 100
EDIFFG = -0.01
2- Compare the lattice parameter that you found with the lattice parameter from the previous step.


D4- Optimize the lattice parameter of graphene. Make sure that the vacuum is large enough at the end of the calculation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E- Density of States 
1- Calculate DOS for GaAs.
* To combine POTCARs of Ga and As you can use a command like this:
"cat /home/course2024/POTCARS/PBE/Ga/POTCAR /home/course2024/POTCARS/PBE/As/POTCAR > POTCAR"
* Use 11 11 11 KPOINTS
* Use the following INCAR:

SYSTEM = GaAs    # arbitrary name
ISTART = 0       # Put 0 if you start from scratch and 1 if you restart a job having the WAVECAR
ISMEAR = 0       # Use Gaussian smearing if you don't know which smearing is better for your material.  0 : Gaussian smearing, -1 : Fermi smearing, There are more read here: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ISMEAR
SIGMA  = 0.05    # Width of Smearing in eV
LORBIT = 11      # Projection into orbitals
NSW    = 0       # Number of Ionic steps
IBRION = -1      # Determines how the ions are updated and moved, use -1 if you don't want movement. (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/IBRION)
ENCUT = 500      # Specifies the energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set in eV.
NELM   = 500     # Maximum number of Electronic steps
NELMIN = 4       # Minimim number of converged electronic steps
PREC = Accurate  # Accuracy of calculation
EDIFF  = 1E-07   # total energy convergence thresold
ALGO   = Fast    # The electronic minimization algorithm 

* After the calculation is done, use vaspkit (code 111) to extract the DOS data and the "python3 dos.py" to plot the data.
* You can use "open dos.png", if it didnt work you can dowload the plot to your computer by "scp course2024@biplab-Precision-7960-Tower.physics.uu.se:{address to file by 'pwd'}/dos.png ."

1.5- Change SIGMA to 0.2 and redo the calculation.

2- Calculate pDOS for GaAs.
* No update in previous calculation is needed. Only use vaspkit (code 113) and "python3 pdos.py".

3- Calculate DOS for Graphene.
*Use 11 11 1 Kpoints.

4- Calculate DOS and pDOS for Au.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F- Electronic band structure
What is reciprocal space?
1- Upload a POSCAR to this website and visualize the reciprocal space and BZ
https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath

For band structure calculation, we need a CHGCAR file from a SCF calculation. Can you guess why?
And then we add "ICHARG = 11" to the INCAR file to tell vasp to read the CHGCAR from SCF.
So INCAR looks like this:

SYSTEM = GaAs    # arbitrary name
ISTART = 0       # Put 0 if you start from scratch and 1 if you restart a job having the WAVECAR
ICHARG = 11
ISMEAR = 0       # Use Gaussian smearing if you don't know which smearing is better for your material.  0 : Gaussian smearing, -1 : Fermi smearing, There are more read here: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/ISMEAR
SIGMA  = 0.05    # Width of Smearing in eV
LORBIT = 11      # Projection into orbitals
NSW    = 0       # Number of Ionic steps
IBRION = -1      # Determines how the ions are updated and moved, use -1 if you don't want movement. (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/IBRION)
ENCUT = 500      # Specifies the energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set in eV.
NELM   = 500     # Maximum number of Electronic steps
NELMIN = 4       # Minimim number of converged electronic steps
PREC = Accurate  # Accuracy of calculation
EDIFF  = 1E-07   # total energy convergence thresold
ALGO   = Fast    # The electronic minimization algorithm 

2- Calculate band structure for GaAs
Use the following KPOINTS and update the paths:
k-points along high symmetry lines
 50  
Line-mode
r
  0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   !G

  0.666666666666666   0.333333333333333   0.000000000000000   !K

  0.666666666666666   0.333333333333333   0.000000000000000   !K
  0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   !G

*Use the following INCAR:

SYSTEM = TEST
ISTART = 0
ICHARG = 11
ISMEAR = 0
SIGMA  = 0.05
LORBIT = 11
NSW    = 0
IBRION = -1
ENCUT = 500
NELM   = 200
NELMIN = 4
PREC = Accurate
EDIFF  = 1E-07
ALGO   = Fast

* Use vaspkit to extract data (211).

* Use band.py to plot the data.

What is the size of band gap? What is the type of band gap? 

3- Calculate the band structure for Si. What is the size and type of band gap?

4- Calculate fatband for gaAs and Si.
You need to use vaspkit (213) to extract the data, and use the "fatband.py" file to plot it.

5- Calculate band structure for graphene.
*Use the following KPOINTS:

k-points along high symmetry lines
 50  
Line-mode
r
  0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   0.000000000000000   !G

6- Calculate the band gap of GaAs as a function of the lattice parameter (Do with primitive cell). 

6(bonus)- Calculate the effective mass for electrons and holes in GaAs. 
Search for effective mass here: "https://vaspkit.com/tutorials.html"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G- Formation Energy and cohesive energy 

Formation and cohesive energies are two quantities that indicate the energetic stability of a crystal.

1- Calculate the formation and cohesive energy of these materials:
I-AlN 
II- SiN with symmetry of AlN
III- (bonus) Which is more stable among Graphene, Carbon Nanotube, C60, and Carbon NanoRibbon (Zigzag and Armchair)? Use the Python file ASE.py to make the structures. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Magnetic materials
Up to here, all the calculations are done in none-spin polarized mode
i.e. spins are degenerate and no magnetism is possible
Now, we will lift the spin degeneracy.
For this we need to include two tags in the INCAR files:

ISPIN = 2  # 2: spin polarized, 1: none-polarized and is the default so we never included up to now.
MAGMOM = 5.0 5.0 0.0 ...   # Initial guess for the magnetic moments of each atoms, so should be as many as atoms

The rest are the same. So, all previous calculations are possible in the spin polarized mode.

1- Optimize the structure of BCC and FCC Iron, in non-magnetic mode. Which one is the ground state?
2- Optimize the structure of BCC and FCC Iron, in magnetic mode. Which one is the ground state?
3- Compare the Total density of states for magnetic and non-magnetic BCC Fe.
4- Calculate the band structure for FM CrI3 monolayer, what is the band gap?
5- Optimize NiO, find the ground state and do Band structure to find t2g eg for NiO. 
6- Calculate the first and second neighbor exchange interactions in NiO (bonus).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Charge density, magnetization density, ELF
The aim here is to visualize how charge density is distributed in the structure, 
and see what partial charge density is.

The total charge density is stored in CHGCAR file. So to see it, its is enough to drag and drop in Vesta.

The partial charge density is stored in PARCHG file, and the following needs to be added to the INCAR file to generate this output:
LPARD = .TRUE.      # Calculate partial charge density
LSEPB = .TRUE.      # Write each band separately
IBAND = 20 21 22 23 45   # band numbers to be included in partial charge
EINT= -2 -1   # energy interval if needed in eV and are not normalized with respect to the Fermi level
In this way charge density can be band or Kpoint decomposed. 

1- Calculate the charge density and partial charge density of GaAs.

2- Calculate the charge density of Graphene.

Magnetization density and change density difference can be calculated via vaspkit. (Num 31)

3- Calculate the magnetization density of NiO.

4- Calculate the charge transfer between Al an graphene.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- LDA va GGA 
It is known that LDA usually underestimates the lattice parameter and GGA overestimates it.
1- Prove this by comparing the LDA, GGA and experimental lattice parameter of bulk Silicon. 
For this you need to use LDA POTCAR. Other inputs are the same as GGA. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Band Gap correction methods: (will be updated)
DFT+U 
Read the DFT+U formalism from here: "https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/DFT%2BU:_formalism"
Hubbard correction is an onsite Columb-like effect that we add to highly correlated electrons to account for their many-body interactions.
This is a way to improve bandgap underestimation in systems with localized d- or f-orbitals. 
To use this method the following tags need to be added to the INCAR file:
LDAU      = .TRUE.       # Enables the DFT+U method (Hubbard correction) in VASP to account for strong on-site Coulomb interactions, commonly used for materials with localized d or f electrons.
LDAUTYPE  = 2            # Specifies the type of DFT+U method: 2 corresponds to the simplified rotationally invariant approach introduced by Liechtenstein.
LDAUL     = 2 -1         # Specifies the angular momentum quantum number (L) for which the U correction is applied. In this case, 2 is for d-electrons (typically transition metals), and -1 means no correction for the second element.
LDAUU     = 3.70 0.00    # Specifies the Hubbard U value in eV for the elements. Here, 3.70 eV is applied to the first element (d-electrons), and 0.00 eV for the second element (no U correction).
LDAUJ     = 0.00 0.00    # Specifies the Hund's exchange parameter J in eV. Here, no exchange interaction (J = 0) is applied for both elements.
LDAUPRINT = 2            # Controls the verbosity of the DFT+U output. A value of 2 gives detailed information about the DFT+U setup and results in the OUTCAR file.
LMAXMIX = 4              # 4 for d electrons and 6 for f electrons

1- Apply Hubbard correction to NiO, with Ueff = 5 eV. Compare the bandgap size with and without Hubbard correction.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Phonon calculations (will be updated) Al FCC vs BCC 
Read more about phonon calculations by VASP and phonopy here: "https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/vasp.html"

For phonon calculations, we usually needs a supercell to make displacement there. We can do this by this command:
phonopy -d --dim="2 2 2" -c POSCAR

Then we copy each displaced POSCAR-00X to a directory according to its number and using the following INCAR, do an scf calculation.

We run this command to calculate force constants:
phonopy -f {1..6}/vasprun.xml

We need a file called band.conf that contains information about phonon band plot:

We run this command to plot the phonon bands:
phonopy -p -s --dim="2 2 2" -c POSCAR band.conf

1- Do phonon calculation for FCC and BCC Al, and see which one is stable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Diffusion (NEB)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Elastic constants and mechanical properties (will be updated)


These tasks are good for people who have a lot of experience working with VASP, and for some Python, and find previous tasks trivial:

Advanced task1: Create zigzag and armchair graphene nanoribbons and graphene nanotube using the ASE python package. Try to optimize the structure, calculate and plot the band structure.
Advanced task2: Optimizing 2D systems via ISIF = 3 tag is not possible, do you know why? How can we overcome this problem? Generate a vasp_xy executable and compile it.
Advanced task3: Write a script that uses API key to grab structures with specific features, like special symmetries or band-gap size, automatically from MatreialsProject. Try to optimize those structures automatically using to script.
Advanced task4: Try to calculate the spin-spiral state for FCC Fe.
