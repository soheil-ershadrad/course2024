VASP Hands Ons:

We always need at least 4 initial input files to start a VASP job.

POSCAR : contains structural information
INCAR : contains the tags that tells details of our jobs to the software
KPOINRS : contains information about grids in reciprocal lattice
POTCAR : contains predefined potentials

Other inputs may be required for specific calculations. 

POSCAR format:
line1 : comment
line2 : scale for lattice parameters
line3-5 : lattice vectors 
line6 : elements
line7 : number of elements
line8 : cartesian or direct, tell about how we define atomic coordination with respect to lattice vector
line9-n : atomic coordinations

POSCAR example:
AFM  NiO
 4.17
 1.0 0.5 0.5
 0.5 1.0 0.5
 0.5 0.5 1.0
 Ni  O
 2   2
Cartesian
 0.0 0.0 0.0
 1.0 1.0 1.0
 0.5 0.5 0.5
 1.5 1.5 1.5

KPOINTS example:
k-points
 0
gamma
 4  4  4 
 0  0  0

* we usually only modify  4th line that specifies number of cuts along each direction in reciprocal space

POTCAR files are provided by VASP developers and are licensed, so we need to download them.

To understand INCAR tags the best reference is VASP wiki.


1- self consistence field calculations (SCF)
Here we only solve the schrodinger equation (Kohn-Sham equation) for electrons. 
We will have some iterations (electronic steps) to find the electronic configuration that minimizes the total energy.
